Loops and similar functionalities are critical for utilizing data structures. 

As with most object oriented programming languages, everything is an object.Everything.
Which seems confusing and very abstract-- and it is! Though what's incredibly helpful to
know is what data structure the object is represented as. Once you know  which structure it is and how
to traverse it, we now have the chance to use data structure methods to get values and work with them.
The same goes for any built in functionality associated. When we know that, we know how to work with and 
utilize the functionality something may have, just like as if we were making our own objects. 

Algorithms are a natural subject that's associated with data structures because using data 
structures in creative and efficient ways will allow you to tackle all sorts of programming problems.

Data structures are a way to organize information.
Mutable - Can be changed after creation. It is potentially dynamic.
Immutable - Can not be changed after creation. It is fixed.

Iterators - An object with a state so that it can know and remember where it is during iteration so they can get their next value. They're also iterable.
Iterables - Something that can be looped over. This is most data structures we deal with.

Hasattr() - Checks if an object has a specified attribute or not.

   - Lists (Arrays) -
*----------------------*
Array_Name = [Item_1, Item_2, Item_3]
Empty_Array = [] or Empty_Array = list()


*-----------------*
   - Dictionary -
*-----------------*
Also known as hash maps or associative arrays. These work well as key-value pairs.
Dictionary_Name = {
    Key_Name_1: Corresponding_Value_1,
    Key_Name_2: Corresponding_Value_2,
    Key_Name_3: Corresponding_Value_3,}


*-------------*
   - Tuples -
*-------------*
Can't be modified. Great for values that you know won't change or don't want to be altered upon creation.
Think of tuples as the equivalent of constants; they're not meant to change.

Tuple_Name = (Item 1, Item 2, Item 3)
Empty_Tuple = () or Empty_Tuple = tuple()


*------------*
   - Sets -
*------------*
Unordered collections of values with no duplicates
Set_Name = {"Item 1", "Item 2", "Item 3"}
Empty_Set = set()

   ---- Modules ----
*---------------------*
Modules are collections of code that intend to provide a certain functionality you can use in your project 
so you don't have to make the code yourself. Some come with the language itself, called the standard library, 
but you can also install 3rd party modules very easily with a package managager. All you'd have to do is go to
a command terminal and enter "pip install [module name]" and you'll have it. From there, it's just a matter of 
learning the module's functions so you can implement it into your own project. 

There are three main types of modules in Python, those you write yourself, 
those you install from external sources, and those that are preinstalled with Python.
 
External modules are pieces of code that other people have written to fulfill common tasks.
Many third-party Python modules are stored on the Python Package Index (PyPI).
The best way to install these is using a program called pip. 

To use a module is to add "import [module_name]" at the top of your code
Modules with subdirectories can be accessed with a full stop (.). So SomeModule.Subfolder would be how you could access
the capabailities of whatever is being held in that subfolder. Which is great!
